Print Element Location

Write a program to print all the locations at which a particular element (taken as input) is found in a list and also print the total number of times it occurs in the list. The location starts from 1.



For example, if there are 4 elements in the array:

5

6

5

7



If the element to search is 5 then the output will be:

5 is present at location 1

5 is present at location 3

5 is present 2 times in the array.

Sample Test Cases



Test Case 1

Input



4

5

6

5

7

5



Output



5 is present at location 1.

5 is present at location 3.

5 is present 2 times in the array.

 

Test Case 2

 Input

5

67

80

45

97

100

50



Output

50 is not present in the array.

 

def find_element_locations(lst, target):

    locations = []

    count = 0

    for i in range(len(lst)):

        if lst[i] == target:

        	locations.append(i + 1)

        	count += 1

   

    return locations, count

 

def main():

    n = int(input())

    lst = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

    target = int(input())

 

    locations, count = find_element_locations(lst, target)

 

    if count == 0:

        print(f"{target} is not present in the array.")

    else:

        for loc in locations:

        	print(f"{target} is present at location {loc}.")

        print(f"{target} is present {count} times in the array.")

 

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()
